    <h1>PEOPLE POWER </h1>
    <p> In human daily lives, people always search for love, companion … In general, we can assume that human
        needs communication. With the development of the internet, new way to communicate were invented and
        developed so fast in the start of 2000s. This new way of communication has changed the internet and
        social media from the web change the people to people change the web.</p>

    <p>The start of this revolution started out with 2 start-ups that shaped the road for the new social media
        and social communication: Digg and Youtube. In the old time, in order to get on TV, each host had a crew
        and travelled around to film and pushed the video to the TV. This process costed the huge amount of
        money and average people couldn’t do things like that. But with Youtube, people could film and broadcast
        their video on Youtube. In the same page for news, in the old time, news was only published by editors
        and news organizer like New York Times. However, with Digg, people could share and public news freely
        and Digg’s system let people to vote for the news. If the news had more vote it would be pinned
        permanently. </p>

    <p>Along with the development of Digg and Youtube another technology was developed that is the .MP3. The
        .mp3 file compress the audio files into a small and effective version which is easy to move around the
        internet. Therefore, users could upload, store, play and download music from the internet. By this
        development, more people sought out for music and download it regardless the copyright. But it was hard
        and time consuming to find music. One software was created in order for people to download music
        directly from the collection of other people. The technology behind this software is peer to peer
        connection and this software’s name is Napster. Napster was created by Shawn Fanning, which let people
        to have their own collection and download music directly from other people’s collection which place in
        other PC. In 6/1999, there were 10000 people download music using Napster per week which empty the old
        school music shop. However, Napster did not consider about the copyright of music. Consequently, it
        started out a controversial problem between Napster and music producing company. Many music record
        companies started to question about the copyright, also the music artist such as Metalika triggered a
        discussion in the community about this problem. Metalika wanted Napster to ban all the users who had
        download their music from Napster. In May 2000, RIAA sued Napster and Napster had to shut down. This
        story inspired companies such as Apple to create Itunes Music Store, where people have to pay for songs
        and maintain the copyright of the songs.</p>
    <p>In the same manner, Youtube users uploaded recorded famous TV shows to Youtube which also create the same
        controversial problem. Youtube was sued as well, but not alike with Napster, Youtube had a big sugar
        daddy – Google – supported whichs helped Youtube to stand strong and survive the sue. After that Youtube
        has tried so hard to maintain the copyright until these days. </p>

    <p>In the stories of above companies, we can see that not only backend editors create the content but also
        now can create and publish content. These changes created Web 2.0, where now people are the one who
        create the contents. Two of the most innovative pioneers in Web 2.0 are My Space and Facebook. My space
        created a social media website which gave the users a webpage that can be customized by the will of the
        users. Supported by Murphy, Myspace became a biggest social media network in 2002. With the same
        ambition, Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook which mapped all the relationships that people can have and
        generated the social graph. Facebook also create a platform for users can create pages to share
        meaningful information. This leaded to a new type of advertising as well. </p>
