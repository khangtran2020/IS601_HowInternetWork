    <h1>Domain name and ICANN </h1>
    <h2>What is Domain Name?</h2>
    <p style="align-content: center">What is Domain name? Have you ever wondered about it? You must have heard about it
        a lot since it’s the age of the internet, but just like most of internet users, you don’t know what it is. Then,
        this post will answer that question of you. </p>
    <p style="align-content: center">The Internet is a giant network of computers connected to each other through a
        global network of cables. Each computer on this network can communicate with other computers. To identify them,
        each computer is assigned an IP address. It is a series of numbers that identify a particular computer on the
        internet. A typical IP address looks like this: 66.249.66.1</p>
    <p style="align-content: center">Now an IP address like this is quite difficult to remember. Imagine if you had to
        use such numbers to visit your favorite websites. It’s hard to remember them, right? Domain name comes to
        rescue.</p>
    <p style="align-content: center">A domain name is your website name. A domain name is the address where Internet
        users can access your website. A domain name is used for finding and identifying computers on the Internet.
        Computers use IP addresses, which are a series of number. However, it is difficult for humans to remember
        strings of numbers. Because of this, domain names were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet
        rather than using IP addresses.</p>
    <ul>For example, these are some popular domain names:
        <li>www.google.com</li>
        <li>www.facebook.com</li>
        <li>www.amazon.com</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="align-content: center">A domain name can be any combination of letters and numbers, and it can be used in
        combination of the various domain name extensions, such as .com, .net and more. The price of a domain name
        typically runs between $15-25 per year. </p>

        <img src="image/domain.png" alt="how domain works">
        <figcaption>Fig.1 - How domain names work. In this image, the process when you go to the link in browser is
            illustrated. The domain name is searched by the computer, the DNS and then get the real IP address.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>When you enter a domain name in your web browser, it first sends a request to a global network of servers that
        form the Domain Name System (DNS). These servers then look up for the name servers associated with the domain
        and forward the request to those name servers. When they found it, they will send it back to your computer and
        you can access it. The structure of a domain can be described as below: </p>

        <figcaption>Fig.2 - The structure of a domain name</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>So, who manage the domain names? It’s a very interesting question, right? Because without a manage what if domain
        names get multiply and being the same with each other? The manager of domain names is ICANN.</p>
    <h2>What is ICANN?</h2>
    <p>ICANN, which stands for Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, is a non-profit organization that
        was established in the United States in 1998 to help maintain the security of the Internet and allow it to be
        usable by all. Anytime you register a domain on the Internet, you go through a domain name registrar, who pays a
        small fee to ICANN to register your domain as part of the domain registration process.</p>
    <p>While ICANN doesn’t control what content goes on the Internet, meaning it cannot regulate Internet access or help
        to stop spam from occurring, it does help keep the web safe by developing and enforcing policy on the Internet’s
        unique identifiers. These unique identifiers are the name and number that you type into the address bar when
        conducting a search for a given site. The address for that site has to be unique so computers know where to find
        each other.</p>
    <p>By helping to coordinate these unique identifiers all over the world, ICANN allows us to have a global Internet.
        In doing so, ICANN also helps promote competition on the web and plays a vital role in the expansion and
        evolution of the Internet.</p>

        <img src="image/icann.png" alt="ICANN">
        <figcaption>Fig.3 - ICANN logo</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2>Structure of ICANN</h2>
    <p>ICANN as a whole is actually made up of several different groups, which each represent a different section of the
        Internet. Each group contributes to any final decisions made by ICANN. These supporting organizations of ICANN
        represent IP addresses, domain names, and country code top-level domains.</p>
    <p>There are also four advisory committee teams that offer ICANN advice. These advisory committee groups represent
        government bodies and international treaty organizations, root server operators, Internet privacy and security,
        and the at-large community (referring to the average Internet user).</p>
    <p>Finally, there is a technical liaison group that works with organizations to provide basic protocols for Internet
        technologies. All ICANN final decisions are made by its Board of Directors. The Board has 21 total members, 15
        of whom have voting rights, while the remaining six are non-voting liaisons. Eight of the voting members are
        chosen by an independent nominating committee, while the rest are nominated by supporting organizations.</p>
    <p>ICANN also has a President and CEO, who direct the ICANN staff and its work. This staff is located all over the
        world in different countries and coordinates their efforts with supporting organizations and advisory
        committees.</p>
