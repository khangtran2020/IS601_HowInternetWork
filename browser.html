    <h1>BROWSER WARS</h1>
    <p style="align-content: center">Ever since the Internet boom kicked off in mid 1990s, there has been no looking back.
        The Web was still a fuzzy thing at that time, but those who checked out Web at such a crucial time,
        found themselves at the climax of the technological race between two browsers.
        It was a conflict at that time – widespread, publicized and had far reaching implications.
        It’s repercussions would create an impact on web designers and common people for years to come.
        If you became familiar with Web in era around 1995, there are high stakes that you would be
        using one particular browser to do it: Netscape Navigator. </p>
    <img src="./image/browser.jpg" alt="Internet">
    <p>Netscape gained a high popularity in the internet world.
        The company began during a research conducted by software engineer Marc Andreessen at
        University of Illinois in 1994.
        While studying there, he worked on the development of one of the very first browsers
        at that time called Mosaic. It became very popular because of the few available browser options at that time.
        The browser released by Andreessen and his team came to be known as Netscape Navigator.   </p>

        </div>

    </div>
    <p>If you were trying to connect with Web around 1995,
        you would most likely head to your local computer hardware and software shop and
        ask around for what browser options were available for sale.
        Though a little unexpected, but there were a few alternatives to Netscape that were famous.
        Spyglass Incorporated had licensed code from NCSA to create their own browser.
        So if you asked for recommendation from shop owner, he would probably end up suggesting you to use Netscape.
        In the months leading up to the release of Netscape in end of 1994, the team launched their beta testing
        program which helped them identify bugs quickly. After the official release,
        Netscape gave away several versions for free download to users. In the first release itself,
        the browser covered broader support for images, cookies and design elements.
    </p>
    <p>Making a site which was supported by Netscape was dream turning into reality for many designers. Each subsequent release gave rise to a more stable version and complete version. It allowed the designers to add more support for interactivity and flexibility. These websites would often appear broken in other browsers, but given the fact that Netscape had 80% of market share at that time, coding for Netscape seemed the only viable option.
        By the time Netscape version 2 was released, the company had gathered quite a significant amount of revenue and just within a year, the company went public owing the lauded efforts from media and Marc Andreessen who had gained a rock star status by that time. But soon after this, Netscape encountered it’s first original competition in the digital world: Microsoft.
        lly these rules became the lingua franca of the internet architecture. During the same period of time, Congress decided to commercialize the Web. The reason behind the jubilant victory of internet is it’s flexibility. It fetches data to and from billions of devices conveying our messages across variety of network in fraction of second’s time.
    </p>
    <p>A few months before Netscape’s IPO, Microsoft engineers paid a visit to this office to lay hands on the
        browser technology as they planned the future of Microsoft.
        A drawback with using Microsoft at that time was that if you used a Windows OS on your machine,
        you would need to purchase a browser separately. However, as the consumer base of Microsoft increased,
        they demanded for an integrated browser to accommodate their needs.
        Hence employees began setting up web servers and a centralized information hub which would later go on to become
        Microsoft Network. Bolstered by this demand from their clients,
        Microsoft began working on designing a new browser and ended up having a joint meeting with Netscape.  </p>
    <p>
        Over the years, this meeting resulted into a sequence of meetings which did not go well on Netscape’s side. Microsoft offered them a meagre sum of money to hand over their browser code base to them. Netscape was already threatened by this. From that day, it lead to a Cold War between the two companies, followed by a series of conflicts. As Netscape’s success increased, Microsoft developed their own browser which came to be known as “Internet Explorer”. Over the next few years this war raged and both the companies used to release some update every month.
        For Microsoft, Internet Explorer was an integral part of their business and Windows couldn’t function without it. However in 1998, Netscape was sold off which marked the end of an era. Eventually Microsoft gained a complete control over the browser market. By early 2000s, the browser war ended and with that began a period of stagnation. This was followed by launch of several different browsers leading to a period of growth and innovation for other browsers.
