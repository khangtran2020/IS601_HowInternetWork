    <h1>DOT COM BUBBLE </h1>
    <p style="align-content: center">In the late of 1990s, the evolution of capitalism had a new face which,
        nowadays, is known as e-commerce. E-commerce started out at the early of the 90s and it developed so
        fast and strong at the end of the same century. It has changed the face of business since then, and
        everything has changed along with that development of new business.</p>
    <img src="./image/ecommerce.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli">
    <p>In this development and outburst, two big companies were founded and made a big push to the e-commerce:
        Amazon.com and eBay. Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos. At the start of it, Amazon was a book company.
        Jeff Bezos made a list of the things that were bought the most and he came up with the idea: selling
        book online. In another hand, Pierre Omidyar – founder of eBay – did not have any business strategy. He
        started out eBay with an idea that people can access, selling and trading through the internet.
        Therefore, he put out a work on developing a website where all of that could happen. Despite the methods
        that these two multi-millionaires took were different, the fact was that these two companies succeeded
        immediately and gain so much incomes in just a couple of months. In just 4 years, more than 50 million
        users use the amazon.com to buy book and access to eBay to trade. </p>

        <div class="col">
            <img src="./image/ebay.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli">
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>With this development, Amazon.com and eBay attracted the eyes of Wall street. Analysists of Wall street
        started to question that how these two companies could grow that fast. There were two big technical
        effects that helped Amazon.com and eBay grew that fast which were silicon chips and the ethernet. With
        the strong power of the silicon chips and the ethernet, more powerful PC and more connections were made
        which increased a huge number of users who access to the internet. With the growth in the number of
        internet users, the internet started to have big potential in finance and became a larges market in the
        whole world. </p>
    <p>In 1997, both eBay and Amazon.com and along with other commercial websites started to issue the Initial
        Public Offering (IPO) which started a new type of trading and financial trading center. Investors
        started to invest in these companies’ shares. One of the biggest differences between this trading market
        compares to the old methods is that the shares would not only be able accessed by the traders at Wall
        street but also the public people. Consequently, a new sport was established – the trading sport. Many
        people started to trade, they bought the shares online in the morning and sole it in the end of the day.
        Due to the growth of these shares, traders gained a huge amount of money with this “sport”. </p>
    <p>By 1998, witnessing these potentials, many start-up companies were founded and joined the game. Many .com
        website were put on the site: pet.com, iBus.com … With the rise of these companies, the trading power
        really was taken from the Wall street and given back to the hand of the public users. Many people who’s
        known as traders spent all day to watch CBN to pick the time to sale the stocks. Investor put more and
        more money to these companies without considering whether the companies would succeed in order just to
        buy a piece of the future. Many of them knew that the company wouldn’t last for couple of months but
        they still invested and recommended it to other users. </p>
    <img src="./image/dotcom.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli">
    <p>Witnessing the growth of the .com company which made the trade market so hot, Greenpay bank decided to
        put the end to the bubbles of the internet. On April of 2000, after one black Friday, many companies’
        shares dropped their values which create a biggest hit in the e-commerce. 18 months after that, 9/11
        happened which put the real end to the dot com bubbles. Valuation bubbles burst because people know that
        there isn’t a rational basis for the valuation but don’t want to miss out. So investors buy. Anything.
        So the bubble continues to grow and then something happens and people get nervous. Just like they didn’t
        want to lose out on the valuations going up…they don’t want to get caught with the valuation going down.
        So, they sell and the selling begets more selling and the bubble bursts.</p>
