    <h1>INTERNET SEARCH ENGINE</h1>
    <p style="align-content: center">The Google and Yahoo that we see today are smarter than what they used to be.
        The use Artificial Intelligence algorithms to process the information and display results to users.
        But the internet years back wasn’t so easy to navigate as it is today.
        Search results yielded more spam than the actual search query and getting new information
        from search engines took weeks of time. Over the period of years, search engines have changed drastically.
        At the beginning of the new millennium, Google and Yahoo started out on vastly different paths for internet search.</p>
    <img src="./image/google2.jpg" alt="Internet">
    <p>For Yahoo, the solution came in the form of NetApp  filers, which allowed the company to add server space at a dizzying rate. Almost every service that Yahoo offered ultimately ran on NetApp’s purpose-built storage appliances, which were quick to set up and easy to use, giving Yahoo a fast track to meet market demand (and soon made the company NetApp’s largest customer).
        But in nearby Mountain View, Google began work on engineering its own software-defined infrastructure, ultimately known as the Google File System, which would function as a platform that could serve a diverse range of use cases for all the services Google would offer as part of its future ecosystem. Instead of using the latest storage appliances as a foundation, the Google File System used commodity servers to support a flexible and resilient architecture that could solve scalability and resiliency issues once and for all, simplifying and accelerating the future rollout of a wide range of web-scale applications, from maps to cloud storage.
    </p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
            <img src="./image/yahoo.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli">
        </div>

    </div>
    <p>It took four years of ongoing development, and enormous amounts of engineering resources, before the Google File System reached the point where the company used it for mission-critical operations. Meanwhile, Yahoo had been able to add NetApp filers almost immediately to keep up with growing demands for its services. In the race to dominate the Internet landscape, it appeared Yahoo had pulled far ahead.
        However, Yahoo’s rapid go-to-market approach also began to show some cracks. As demand continued to expand and diversify, downsides to the appliance-based infrastructure emerged in the form of redundant engineering work, increasingly complex and inefficient environments and finally, mounting vendor costs. When Yahoo added a new service, it needed to re-engineer the NetApp platform for that specific use case.

    </p>
    <p>As a result, identical challenges for separate services, such as Yahoo Search and Yahoo Mail, had to be solved multiple times on different infrastructures. The fragmented infrastructure also exposed greater resource inefficiencies, as each use case required separate server space and compute power that couldn’t be shared across the platform. On top of that, the cost to run NetApp appliances grew as fast as Yahoo did, taking a significant bite out of the company’s revenue.
        Google built a broad platform that extends across the entire web by focusing on simplicity and flexibility, while the complexity of Yahoo’s infrastructure may be the reason it ends up as a small part of another business.
        commercialize the Web. The reason behind the jubilant victory of internet is it’s flexibility. It fetches data to and from billions of devices conveying our messages across variety of network in fraction of second’s time.
